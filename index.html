  <h1>Shrew</h1>
  <p>A shrew is a <strong>very</strong> small animal</p>
 <p> <em>American Pygmy Shrews</em> often stand on their hind legs like a Kangaroo; they are very agile and can jump as high as 4 inches.</p>
 <p> This mole is often active above ground, foraging in <STRONG>leaf litter for earthworms, insects, snails and slugs. It is also known to eat some vegetation such as mycorrhizal fungi and even salamanders</STRONG>, but earthworms are the most important food item in its diet.</p>
